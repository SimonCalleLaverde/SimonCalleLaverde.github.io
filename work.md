Although I studied marketing and advertisement for 5 years, I worked at Code Nation an Australian 5 star rated digital agency for the past 4 years working with campaigners and helping them achieve their goals with our tools and awesome platforms. The branding and design steps were done by the designers while I got into the development phase to create those sites made mostly in Illustrator, Photoshop, or Adobe XD come to live by re-doing them in HTML, SCSS, Liquid, and JavaScript, some of them you can see below.

The workflow included also managing the backend right away which was the heart of the websites and allowed us to create many types of pages like Donation pages, Volunteer pages, Calendars and Events, Blogs and Blog Posts, Petitions, Endorsements, and many others while making those interactive sites dynamic with NationBuilder's CMS as well, allowing the owners to manage content and add or remove text, images, news, events, as they pleased or even create new pages, petitions and more. Always working closely with the clients and the rest of the team to handle any feedback or revision.

Some sites were done using NationBuilder which is a campaigning CMS and platform, a few others using Jekyll, the tool I'll be using the most for some next projects. Repower Australia which I developed in Jekyll and was designed by the team at Code Nation was winner of a <i>Reed Award</i> for <i>"Best International Campaign Website"</i> in February of this year, 2019.
