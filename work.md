Although I studied advertisement for 5 years, I worked at Code Nation an Australian 5 star rated digital agency for the past 4 years working with campaigners and helping them achieve their goals with our tools and awesome platforms. Branding and design was done by the designers while I got into the development phase to create and make those interactive sites come to live, some that you can see below. Also managing the backend and making the sites dynamic with Nation Builder's CMS as well while working closely to work-out any feedback or revision from the clients.

Some sites were done using Nation Builder which is a campaigning CMS and platform, and a few using Jekyll, the tool I'll be using the most for the next projects. Repower Australia which I developed in Jekyll and was designed by the team at Code Nation was winner of a <i>Reed Award</i> for <i>"Best international campaign website"</i> in February, 2019.
