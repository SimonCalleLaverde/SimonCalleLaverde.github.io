Although I studied advertisement, marketing, and branding for 5 years, I worked at Code Nation an Australian 5 star rated digital agency for the past 4 years working with campaigners and and helping them achieve their goals with our tools and awesome developed platforms. Branding and web design was done by the designers while I got into developing phase to create the live interactive sites that you can see below, as well as managing Nation Builder's backend and making the sites also dynamic with the CMS while working closely to workout any feedback or vision from the client.

Some sites were done using Jekyll tho the tool I'll be using the most for the next projects, including one winner of a <strong>Reed Award</strong> for <strong>"Best international campaign website" being that one <i>Repower Australia</i></strong>.
