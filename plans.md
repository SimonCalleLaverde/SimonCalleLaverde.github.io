I'll let this simple. I'll base my prices on some sources like this ones <a class="text-blue-light" href="neolo.com/blog/cuanto-deberia-cobrar-crear-sitio-web.php">Source</a>, as well as based in the work I used to do for the last 5 years which were mostly big projects with a lot of pages and actions.

... I'm planning to start implementing some more javascript, frameworks, and animation platforms like GSAP on future websites to enlive them and make the products and brands shine with dynamism and character. My idea is to little by little enrich myself with the best web practices and start applying my knowledge to create awesome websites and unforgettable branding that could soon compete with the rest of CSS WINNER and AWWWARD websites out there, which might also affect my plans and prices in the future. My plan is to also maintain any recent website created with the current plans I have up to date in the future adding to them any small





Easy Going Plan - We will use a <a class="text-blue-light" href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> template with little customization, or a simple CSS and HTML <a class="text-blue-light" href="https://startbootstrap.com/themes/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> template. I'll add all your content, remove or add small sections if they aren't needed or they are urgent to have, and simple changes like switching colours or small adjustments.

DemonSlasher (CodeSlasher) - This plan will introduce a custom template starting from scratch with basic <a class="text-blue-light" href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> grids and code, integrating <a class="text-blue-light" href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> to it for possible Blog or News pages and possibly making the site dynamic with <a class="text-blue-light" href="https://forestry.io/" target="_blank">Forestry's</a> CMS, which will consider a small extra cost. The website can have colours and features alike to your current brand or feel, it will consist of a couple of pages. Another option is a simple static site of a couple of pages made up in <a class="text-blue-light" href=="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a> also with a custom design from my part, with possibility of hosting anywhere.

Pro Coder Plan - Full customized and developed website using <a class="text-blue-light" href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free" target="_blank">Jekyll's</a> environment with HTML, SASS, Liquid, Javascript, GSAP code similar to how this <i>portfolio</i> was done, where you have a logo and an identity already; I'll do the design and development for you. An additional topping can be a logo which I'll call for it.

E-Commerce Plan - We might use Jekyll's e-commerce, or Prestashop, or Shopify, or Woo-commerce from wordpress.

Brainstorming Plan - Full branding and hand-crafted entire custom website using <a class="text-blue-light" href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free" target="_blank">Jekyll's</a> environment with HTML, SASS, Liquid, Javascript, GSAP code, similar to how this <i>portfolio</i> was done.
