I worked in the great team of Code Nation Australia for more than 4 years. We created dozens of awesome campaign websites and platforms for dozens of happy clients and thousands of happy users, who could raise their voices through successful and very useful custom digital interfaces with robust usability and customized design.<!--Same from LinkedIn experience-->

In my previous company, we created lots of sites that helped thousands of people and moved hundreds of causes. Now, I want to continue my job of helping people to put their businesses names out there with good design and hight quality websites that show their goals and personality.

I'm now very passionate in interactive design and bringing live to brands throught awesome sites that break the common rules of the web and let them show exactly what they want, with hand-crafted designs and great user experience.<!--Description I had written couple months ago from launch, I like-->
