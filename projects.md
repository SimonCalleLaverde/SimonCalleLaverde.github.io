Hi there!

Here I'm showcasing some projects I had the opportunity<!-- got--> to work on in the past years.

The first two projects are some experimental which I worked recently (during those pandemic times) as independent doing UI design and development completely.

I worked with the great team of <a class="text-rosybrown" href="https://www.codenation.com/" target="_blank">Code Nation</a>, a five star rated digital and creative agency headquartered in Australia for over 4 years; we developed dozens of awesome websites and campaigning platforms for clients and organizations around the world, both onsite and remotely, helping in some political and environmental cases and issues around the world.

We were doing this online thing before it was cool, working 2 years remotely and meeting sometimes in Colombia and/or Australia.
