Hello! Here I'm displaying some case studies I'm actively working on.

I worked with the great team of <a class="text-rosybrown" href="https://www.codenation.com/" target="_blank">Code Nation</a>, a five star rated digital and creative agency headquartered in Australia for over 4 years; we developed dozens of awesome websites and campaign platforms for awesome clients around the world both onsite and remotely, to help this planet a bit. Most of the projects displayed here are those which I worked in the development phase starting from a base design and a base template we iterated on, and worked on most of the development phase at the time. Some may have new changes throught the years.

I'm currently occasionally taking on freelance projects! Although this year was a roller coaster. I have been also improving on my skills: I've been learning much more about <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">UX research</em>, <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">UI design</em>, <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">web best practices</em>, as well as improving my coding skills with <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">JavaScript</em> and <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">React.js</em>. The first projects are a few I had the opportunity to recently design & develop completelly.

I'm also working on some desings-only to display and better show my UI design skills which really started more than 6 years ago with a University course in <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">Web Design and Design for Mobile Devices</em> after a 5 year creative and design focused career where I also had to create complete digital marketing campaigns including wireframing, prototyping, and creating mockups (at that time with Adobe Fireworks and Adobe Dreamweaver,<!--<img src="/uploads/smile-face.png" style="height:15px">--> although today I use mostly Adobe XD and I have knowledge on Figma).<!--and Sketch--><!--<img src="/uploads/heart.webp" style="height:15px">-->

I worked in the great team of Code Nation Australia for more than 4 years. We created dozens of awesome campaign websites and platforms for dozens of happy clients and thousands of happy users, who could raise their voices through successful and very useful custom digital interfaces with robust usability and customized design.<!--Same from LinkedIn experience-->

In my previous company, we created lots of sites that helped thousands of people and moved hundreds of causes. Now, I want to continue my job of helping people to put their businesses names out there with good design and hight quality websites that show their goals and personality.

I'm now very passionate in interactive design and bringing live to brands throught awesome sites that break the common rules of the web and let them show exactly what they want, with hand-crafted designs and great user experience.<!--Description I had written couple months ago from launch, I like-->
