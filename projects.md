Hi! Here I'm displaying some <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">case studies</em> I'm actively working on.

I worked with the great team of <a class="text-rosybrown" href="https://www.codenation.com/" target="_blank">Code Nation</a>, a five star rated digital and creative agency headquartered in Australia for over 4 years; we developed dozens of awesome websites and campaign platforms for awesome clients and organizations around the world both onsite and remotely, helping this planet a bit. Most of the projects displayed here are those which I worked in the development phase starting from a base design and a base template that we iterated on, and worked on most of the development phase at the time. Some may have new changes by them or by the clients themselves throught the years.

<!--I never really received <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">Mobile</em> or <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">Tablet</em> version designs, so I had to iterate and design this versions on the fly-->
In my previous job, I used to receive a <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">desktop</em> design to start each project, although<!--never really received--> I had to create the <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">tablet</em> and <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">mobile</em> versions during development phase for each website most of the time at the end of the development, verifying everything worked well for all devices and iterating in some design changes for each version, each project being completelly responsive and most of them very <a class="text-rosybrown" href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/accessibility" target="_blank" rel="ugc">accessible</a> from different devices including screen-readers<!--for any type of device-->. Also working mostly in close communication with the clients to work towards their final feedback and needs, working towards their real content and making everything work, working in final small design tweaks whenever they needed, new features or new sections they required. We would also work with them when they needed something else throught the years.

<a class="text-rosybrown" href="http://repoweraustralia.org.au/" target="_blank">Repower Australia</a> is a good example of a detailed <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">mobile</em> version and responsive layout looking at it in a smaller device or re-sizing the window screen; I made everything adapt differently<!-- in smaller screens-->.

I'm mostly focusing on<!-- very-->polished and detailed <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">mobile</em>, <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">tablet</em>, and <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">desktop</em> experiences as well as <!--placing -->accessibility on top and a focus<!-- focusing--> on a holistic design in my newly independent projects, including the last two I created: <a class="text-rosybrown" href="https://calle-impresores.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Calle Impresores</a> and <a class="text-rosybrown" href="https://jomairaimagen.com/" target="_blank">Jomaira Imagen</a> as well as this portfolio which you can see in any device with a similar experience but a bit different and unique feel, design, and even different features and content.

<!--I'm currently occasionally taking on freelance projects! Although this year was a roller coaster. I have been also improving on my skills: I've been learning much more about <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">UX research and strategy</em>, <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">UI design</em>, <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">Web Best Practices</em>, as well as improving my coding skills with <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">JavaScript</em>, <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">React.js</em>, and <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">Liquid Code</em>. The first projects are a few I had the opportunity to recently design and develop completelly.-->

I'm also working on some conceptual desings-only and case studies to display soon and better show my <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">UI design</em> skills which really started more than 6 years ago with a university course in <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">Web Design and Design for Mobile Devices</em> I took in the <a class="text-rosybrown" href="https://www.javeriana.edu.co/home" target="blank">Pontificia&nbsp;Universidad&nbsp;Javeriana</a> after a 5 year creative advertising and advertising design focused career where I also created complete digital marketing campaigns including wireframing, prototyping, and creating mockups, at the time with Adobe Fireworks and Adobe Dreamweaver,<!--<img src="/uploads/smile-face.png" style="height:15px">--> although today I use mostly Adobe XD and I have knowledge on Figma and Sketch.<!--<img src="/uploads/heart.webp" style="height:15px">-->

I worked in the great team of Code Nation Australia for more than 4 years. We created dozens of awesome campaign websites and platforms for dozens of happy clients and thousands of happy users, who could raise their voices through successful and very useful custom digital interfaces with robust usability and customized design.<!--Same from LinkedIn experience-->

In my previous company, we created lots of sites that helped thousands of people and moved hundreds of causes. Now, I want to continue my job of helping people to put their businesses names out there with good design and hight quality websites that show their goals and personality.

I'm now very passionate in interactive design and bringing live to brands throught awesome sites that break the common rules of the web and let them show exactly what they want, with hand-crafted designs and great user experience.<!--Description I had written couple months ago from launch, I like-->
