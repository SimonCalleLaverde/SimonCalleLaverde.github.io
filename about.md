Hi, I live in the beautiful country of Colombia, shown in some photos throughout my portfolio. I have a career in marketing and advertising and 6+ years of experience in web development, working 4 years of that time for an international agency and many clients around the world. We started working in a physical environment, but the company decided to move to a remote setting in the last two and a half years that I worked there.<!-- This meant I have a very good working set-up at home.--> In the past years I have been learning much more about web best practices, UX strategy, UI design, and enhancing my design and coding skills alike.

I started my web journey and studies with a web development university course in a recognized university here in my country, the <a href="https://www.javeriana.edu.co/home" target="blank">Pontificia&nbsp;Universidad&nbsp;Javeriana</a>, after graduating from marketing and advertising in the <a href="https://www.utadeo.edu.co/es" target="blank">Universidad&nbsp;Jorge&nbsp;Tadeo&nbsp;Lozano</a>.

I then worked for 4+ years with the great team of <a href="https://www.codenation.com/" target="blank">Code&nbsp;Nation</a> as mentioned, a 5 star rated international company based in Australia. There, we created dozens of robust and powerful campaign websites and platforms for both progressive and big organizations. <a href="/projects">Read&nbsp;some&nbsp;more.</a> <!--we had a couple of occations  where all the team could get together.-->
