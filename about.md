Hi, I live in the beautiful country of Colombia. I have a career in marketing and advertisement and 6+ years of experience in web development, working 4 years of that time for an international company and clients from different countries. I started working in a physical environment, but the company decided to move to a remote setting in the last two and a half years. This meant I have a very good working set-up at home. I enhanced my studies with a web development university course in a recognized university here in my country, the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, after graduating from marketing and advertisement in the Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano. I then worked for 4+ years with the great team of Code Nation, a 5 star rated international company based in Australia. There, we created dozens of robust and powerful campaign websites and platforms for both progressive and big organizations.<!--we had a couple of occations  where all the team could get together.-->
