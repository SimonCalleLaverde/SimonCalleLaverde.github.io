I created the whole first version of this site, altho many additions have been made through the years. Cool icons, graphics and design touches have been added by the designers and other developers making the site highlight even more and the whole awesome collage section in the homepage is all new and was done by co-workers at Code Nation. Also new imagery was added by the client making the site very professional and good looking.
