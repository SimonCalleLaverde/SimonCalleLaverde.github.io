Calle Impresores is a company that works in graphic arts and has more than 30 years in the industry. I re-designed and re-developed their website with a more modern interface, adaptable to any device and with an easier user experience and easier contact. The old site they had was created using Flash, so they needed a much more S.E.O friendly technology and a more modern and faster platform that they are able to edit and expand.

The whole website has a minimal design which makes the content easy to consume, it has very contrasted sections and colors that help accessibility and makes the site easy to read. It has a complete focus on S.E.O for organic searchs, the project has a better keywords research and all best practices in use like full use of meta-tags and attributes to help the company find more clients online.

My first design intention and brief included bringing an online catalogue for them to be able to add their products in the future, as well as somehow make the site resemble a book, a catalogue, or a brochure in some of the elements or interactions, with some slight small playful interactions that integrate conventional elements made out of paper.

<!--This is a concept project I started in 2015 which I'll be getting into again in September, 2019. I will be creating a new more modern design following some of the UI I had already created and polishing the concept, as well as maintaining the classic brand look established since 1987 but making it shine in a modern website.-->
