Calle Impresores is a graphic and print company with 30 years in the industry. I re-made their website with a modern interface, adaptable to any device and with an easier user experience and contact methods. The whole website is very easy to consume, with contrasted sections and colors that help accessibility. With a much better S.E.O research to help the company find more clients online through rough times.

<!--This is a concept project I started in 2015 which I'll be getting into again in September, 2019. I will be creating a new more modern design following some of the UI I had already created and polishing the concept, as well as maintaining the classic brand look established since 1987 but making it shine in a modern website.-->
