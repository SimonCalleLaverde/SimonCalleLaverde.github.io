First created starting with the NationBuilders "Aware V2" theme, this was an early project we worked in at Code Nation. The website has had a lot of changes over the years since I worked it in, with new carousels and plugins, new sections and in-development design changes making it a bit more classic following feedback from the client, it resembles some less the first version I created and the original design from Lully Duque today, but it still uses a very similar structure or barely the same one in terms of UI.
