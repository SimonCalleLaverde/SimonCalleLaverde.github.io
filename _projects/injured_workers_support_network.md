Designed by Viviana Bernal at Code Nation this was for sure one of my favourite sites to develop in the 4 years in the company and was a very recent launch. The client is still working on content and the site might still get some revisions after I left it. The design is so awesome and minimalistic, also working with the latest Bootstrap 4 templates and 4 years with NationBuilder let me polish the site more than some others and finish it with small touches like small fade-in animations and a very responsive layout for mobile devices.

Viviana also designed some other sites I developed too like "Freedom Wheelchairs" and "Front Line Action on Coal" but they are no longer live so I couldn't showcase those.
