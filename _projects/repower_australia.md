Repower Australia is a website winner of a <strong>Reed Award</strong> in February 2019 for <i>Best International Campaign Website</i> and it is one I'm proud of and the same for everyone at Code Nation. Designed by Lully Duque with incredible custom designed infographics and images, telling a story organized by the team and clients as well as organizing a functional UI, was started with a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and Slides theme base code and I made the full development of it. It had a short deadline but I even managed to re-create everything again just as Lully designed it but now as a full website written in HTML, SCSS, and Liquid; also we made everything dynamic using <a href="https://forestry.io/" target="_blank">Forestry</a>. I handled to add putting some extra time as a bonus a lot of clean animations and cool effects like every element entering from the sides or fading, elements appearing while scrolling, the button shadow small unique effect touch and things I tryied to put with love that are not priority for the company's workflow but ended up with an awesome UX, adding up the whole team's work.
