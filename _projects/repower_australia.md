Repower Australia is a website where we in Code Nation won a <strong>Reed Award</strong> in February 2019 for <i>Best International Campaign Website</i> and it is one we were very proud of at my previous company: Code Nation. Designed by Lully Duque with incredible custom designed infographics and images, telling a story organized by the team and clients as well as organizing a functional UI, was started with a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and Slides theme base code and I made the full development of it, as well as the responsive (mobile and tablet) version. It had a short deadline in the development phase but I could re-created everything from Lully's design but now as a full dynamic website together with a CMS for the client to edit everything, written in HTML, SCSS, and Liquid Code; we made everything dynamic using <a href="https://forestry.io/" target="_blank">Forestry.io</a>.
