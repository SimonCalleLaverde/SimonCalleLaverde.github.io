This was an awesome project to work in, some new features like "email your mp" and others have been added through the years to handle the campaigning of protecting The Kimberley. An engaging news section and professional photography accompany this website. Some new sections were added too by members of the team like the carousel of facebook posts at the bottom in the homepage and some other small additions.
