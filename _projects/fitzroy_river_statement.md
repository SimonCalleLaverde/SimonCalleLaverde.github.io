This was a site were I received no design, I had to follow a bit and inspire myself in the client's previous site and some brand examples and new needs, making it a bit more modern, creating it in Html and Css again from scratch and making the sections dynamic so the client could create as many as they want in the Homepage and fill in with content as they wished; the buttons names and Url's are dynamic for them using NationBuilder's CMS, the text can have some small style and column changes easily through the backend using tags.

Design is simple; it was a site made up following functionality and a short deadline.
