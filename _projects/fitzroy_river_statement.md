This was a site were I received no design, it was inspired in an old site of the client and some examples, the sections are also dynamic so for example they could create as many as they want in the homepage, the buttons are dynamic, the text can be spread into one or two columns easily through the backend. It was a site made up following functionality and a short deadline.
