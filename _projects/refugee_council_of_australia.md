This was a full site development with around 7 main pages in the top navigation and from around 3 to 7 subpages in the dropdown of each one of those, with full customization for every page-type in NationBuilder like Feedback, Signup, Volunteer Signup, Donation pages. But at the end for efficiency reasons the client wanted to maintain most of their blog posts and content within their original Wordpress site. The main design from Lully Duque was based a lot in that Wordpress site so they were a bit similar already but still different. I had to work in coordination with that Wordpress site and link pages from one to the other. One main functionality they are using from our site is the Donation page <a href="https://refugeecouncilaus-refugeecouncilaus.nationbuilder.com/donate" target="_blank">here</a>, where NationBuilder is the perfect tool for those type of actions. Later I had to re-create i.e. the footer and some membership and contact us pages closer and resembling their original site <a href="https://www.refugeecouncil.org.au/" target="_blank">here</a>, so the users could transfer from one to the other without a so drastic change and maybe not even noticing it. <a href="https://refugeecouncilaus-refugeecouncilaus.nationbuilder.com/members" target="_blank">This</a> is a membership page I created and <a href="https://www.refugeecouncil.org.au/membership/" target="_blank">this</a> is their original Worpress membership page.
