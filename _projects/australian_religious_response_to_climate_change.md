This is the first website I worked in at Code Nation while getting used to NationBuilder platform and CMS for the first time. Designed by Lully Duque it was a tricky but a nice project to start up with and it was built beginning with one of the NationBuilder's main themes getting to a complete customization and change according to the Australian Religious Response to Climate Change organization's needs and some of Lully's colourful effect design touches which we managed to re-create in code.
