Designed by Lully Duque this was one of the earliest sites I worked in as a member of Code Nation in its beginnings. It is for a health professional group taking action on climate change and they are fully engaged with the site until today creating events and actions using all the dynamic platform we created. The website developed three years ago is still looking great today; it might be one of my favorite designs from Lully, and the images added by the client has given it that magic.
