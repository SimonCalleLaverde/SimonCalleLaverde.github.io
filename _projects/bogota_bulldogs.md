This is the last website I worked in during my time at Code Nation, the Bogota Bulldogs is the first amateur australian football club dedicated to establishing and growing the great australian sport in Bogotá and across Colombia. I finished the full site and left when it was just about to be launched. (The URL is temporary and will change when the site gets live).
