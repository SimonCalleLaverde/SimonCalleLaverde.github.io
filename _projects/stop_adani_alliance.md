Stop Adani Alliance is a campaign site from the same people at <a href="https://www.stopadani.com/">Stop Adani</a> also created by Code Nation, where I have also participated in some development but in some minor way doing small changes and some sections. Stop Adani Alliance tho was started by my team using Jekyll, Forestry, and Slides as a theme and passed to me to fully develop it as per the design, adding also small CSS effect touches.
