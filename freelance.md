<span class="font-light">
	A project including design and development rounds up somewhere between $700 USD to $4,000 USD or more<!--; if the project is big or can involve more people, sometimes more--> depending on the project's size and scope. There are three plans; we can also do branding starting in the medium or large project's plan.
	<br><br><!-- requirements and size.-->
	<!--<br><br>Estimates can vary widely depending on factors like deadlines, expected results, project's spectrum, resources or web features involved, number of pages, complexity of the development phase, if branding or any extra production is needed, and more.--><!-- Prices will be adjusted within one of the three main plans if we are starting already with a full brand guideline or with an existing--><!-- strategy and--><!-- design that is viable for development.
	<br><br>-->Prices are based on 6 years of experience working in the industry, 4 of those working for a digital agency based in Australia, and are competitive in the industry<!-- for any work in custom web development, custom web design, UX research/strategy or UI design-->. As a reference please see <a class="text-aqua" href="https://designagency.io/" target="_blank"><em class="font-light text-italic">this</em></a> pricing tool created by a well known agency in the U.S.A. to compare some industry prices vs. working with a freelancer or contractor. If you are located in Colombia please see <a class="text-aqua" href="https://www.ikkonos.com/ideate/cuanto-debe-cobrar-por-una-pagina-web-en-colombia-si-es-freelancer" target="_blank"><em class="font-light text-italic">this</em></a> article as a reference of prices for a <em class="font-light text-italic">custom</em> website specifically.
	<!--<br><br>For Colombians we can also arrange some good prices adjusted to COP. Please refer to <a class="text-aqua" href="https://www.ikkonos.com/ideate/cuanto-debe-cobrar-por-una-pagina-web-en-colombia-si-es-freelancer" target="_blank"><em class="font-light text-italic">this article</em></a> (in Spanish), it recommends a project rate as a freelancer for a <em class="font-regular text-italic">custom website</em> (not a template based website) for $3'200,000 COP in Colombia (around $1,000 USD) with not too many features, more of just the custom design and template.--><!-- It can be more depending on each project. Every project is very different, but we could arrange a good price that fits.-->
