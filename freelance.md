	A website project rounds up anywhere between USD $800 to USD $6,000 or more. Estimates can vary widely depending on factors like timing, expectations, and each project's spectrum and resources involved; time required, the number of pages, the complexity of the development and/or the design phase, if a complete branding or production is required, the features needed for the website (plugins, video or photo galleries, carousels, popups, complex hover effects, scroll effects, animations, contact or signup forms, backend), among any others.<!--and other factors-->
	<br><br>Prices can be always negociated if for example we are starting from an existing design or a full brand guideline. We can arrange only the development phase if the design is viable.
	<br><br>My prices are based on my 5 years of experience working in an international digital agency and are competitive in the industry. As a reference please see <a class="text-aqua" href="https://designagency.io/" target="_blank">this tool</a>, which some agencies use, to compare the industry prices vs. working with me as a freelancer.
	<br><br>For Colombians we can also arrange some discounts. Please refer to <a class="text-aqua" href="https://www.ikkonos.com/ideate/cuanto-debe-cobrar-por-una-pagina-web-en-colombia-si-es-freelancer" target="_blank">this article</a> in Spanish, which shows how a <em class="font-light text-italic">custom website</em> with not too many custom features and without too much complex customization, will cost around USD $1,000 (over COP $3'200,000).

	<li><span class="d-block font-regular text-aqua text-center text-md-left mb-1">USD $800 - USD $1,500</span><i class="font-light text-italic"> This approximate budget will allow me to create a custom small site of a couple pages, a one pager site or a simple but awesome portfolio. We can also use a template based site, for example using a <a class="text-aqua" href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free" target="_blank">Jekyll Theme</a>, and accommodate your site and content to it, making some modifications to the theme to add a couple new sections or a couple of new features, removing undesired items, changing colors to fit the brand, and more. Basically this plan allows for a small site, custom or template based. A project should take anywhere from 2 weeks to 4 weeks.</i></li>

	<br>
	<li><span class="d-block font-regular text-aqua text-center text-md-left mb-1">USD $1,500 - USD $3,000</span><i class="font-light text-italic"> This will allow me to create a full custom website, with a hand-crafted design that is created to represent your brand and mirror your company's feel. It will have only what you need and will contain only what you want, with a design that you approve in the first or second week. It will have some effects and animations. If we use custom fonts or some plugin with a licence that you agree, approve, and want, like a fancy popup photo gallery, fancy video gallery or something similar, it will be at an extra cost; we can arrange a separate bill for a small cost (i.e Fancy Box Gallery for images and videos costs around $25 USD). Some fonts (i.e Adobe fonts) or some special sites, come at a cost, varying from $30 USD to around $300 USD a complete font family; we will only use any of these features or fonts if you approve as we find that it fits and gives the best image to the brand, or is required for some functionality. A project could and should take anywhere from 3 weeks to 2 months.</i></li>
	<br>
	<br>
	<li><span class="d-block font-regular text-aqua text-center text-md-left mb-1">USD $3,000 - USD $6,000</span><i class="font-light text-italic">This will give me the opportunity to create your full custom site, brand, logo, and all the visual identity if you are looking for a complete branding. I'll try to help and assist in anything else that you need to reach your goals for a couple of months. It will also allow me to add plugins with licences without extra cost, use better stock galleries like 'shutterstock' that use licenced photography of very good quality, if we are using one, and outsource the logo development, a video development, an illustration or some other work to a graphic designer, whilst retaining the lead on the concept and strategy, creating the best resources that fits your brand and site, depending on what we arrange and schedule. A project with full branding and everything customized, which can also require to hire a second-hand production, should take anywhere around 3 weeks to 3 months.</i></li><!--and a site that fits your brand and taste.-->

	<br>
	<li><span class="d-block font-regular text-aqua text-center text-md-left mb-1">USD $6,000 or more</span><i class="font-light text-italic"> This budget will cover almost all the previous proposals/plans and will also allow me to hire a second graphic designer part-time to help with me in the design phase of the project, or hire a video editor, or a second professional to help us in the development phase or any video, photography, illustration, or 3D production, to help you get much better results. It will specially give me more time, which will render in a much better and polished platform, with more revisions and more hours put to it, with multiple engaging effects, page transitions, very customised animations, any relatively big production if it is needed, or anything else you require to help you reach your goals and make you happy. A project like this could take anywhere from 1 month to 3 months.</i></li>
