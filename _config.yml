# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Hello, I'm Simón Calle Laverde a publicist and web developer from Bogotá,
  Colombia. I worked with a 5 star rated Australian based agency for the past
  4 years and now I want to do what I like the most which is front-end
  development and design, as well as the whole branding if needed. I'll be
  working on some freelance projects and I'm happy for you to contact me and
  let me know what your plans are, so I can help you.
