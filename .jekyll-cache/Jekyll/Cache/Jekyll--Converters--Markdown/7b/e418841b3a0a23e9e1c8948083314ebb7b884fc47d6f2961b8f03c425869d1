I"Ú<p>Every great project starts with the <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">strategy</em>, this is the base and main pillar of a website or branding project. After receiving or composing the first brief with the purpose and goals, the UX Research and Strategy phase will consist of takingÂ me through your business, your vision, and your expected results, in a series of meetings at the beginning of the journey. This allows me to get insights into what you desire and align expectations from the start of the design process.</p>

<p><em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">UX Research</em> or <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">User Experience Research</em> is also a crucial part to start a project. This is the way to align user needs and business needs. UX answers the why and how a person uses a product or a service, this is a way to ensure designing for the users and to be their voice. This should cover from research, to principles of <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">accessibility</em> and <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">heuristic design</em>, <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">brainstorming</em> possible ideas and solutions, creating the <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">information architecture</em>, <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">wireframing</em> and <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">prototyping</em>. Depending on the projectâ€™s size we could create user testing and even personas; testing with real users representing a bigger target audience, including journey maps between a user and the product or service, to create a better digital experience as a whole.</p>

<p>If you donâ€™t have <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">branding</em>, we can create your visual identity based on various things. For example, references of what you have seen or liked, your competitorsâ€™ brand, your name, the culture and feel of your company, the experience we want to transmit, your specific target public, a supported<!--researched--> and well founded color scheme, amongst others.Â In this first phase, you will get to understand our use of any visual concept or even why we are choosing a certain color, and you will be able to give feedback on the direction we are taking. Branding is an important step to have a consistent visual identity that should ultimately include a complete visual guideline, but aside of it, should go deep into the culture of the company itself.</p>

Everything starts with the strategy, this is the base and main part of a website project or a branding project. This will consist in talking about it and knowing more about your business and your expected results. This will be set up as one or a series of reunions or chats at the beginning of the work, to align expectations and be sure to get enough insight so that everything is clear to start with a design.

If you don't have a branding we can create your visual identity based on many things: For example references of what you have seen or liked, your competition's brands, your name, the culture of your company or the feel. You will understand why we'll use a certain visual concept or even a certain color, and will be able to give me any feedback on anything. Branding can make the design phase take longer, so that we can get to a succesful result.-->
