I"þ<p>This is the first website I worked in at Code Nation while getting used to NationBuilder platform and CMS for the first time. Designed by Lully Duque it was a tricky but a nice project to start up with and it was built beginning with one of the NationBuilderâ€™s main themes getting to a complete customization and change according to the Australian Religious Response to Climate Change organizationâ€™s needs and some of Lullyâ€™s colourful effect design touches which we managed to re-create in code.</p>
