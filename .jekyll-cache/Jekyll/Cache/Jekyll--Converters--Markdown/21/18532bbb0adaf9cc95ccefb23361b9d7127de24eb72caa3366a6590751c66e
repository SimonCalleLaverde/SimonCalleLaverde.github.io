I"ü<p>Calle Impresores is a company that works in graphic arts and has more than 30 years in the industry. I re-designed and re-developed their website with a more modern interface, adaptable to any device and with an easier user experience and easier contact. The old site they had was created using Flash, so they needed a much more S.E.O friendly technology and a more modern and faster platform that they are able to edit and expand.</p>

<p>The whole website has a minimal design which makes the content easy to consume, it has very contrasted sections and colors that help accessibility and makes the site easy to read. It has a complete focus on S.E.O for organic searchs, the project has a better keywords research and all best practices in use like full use of meta-tags and attributes to help the company find more clients online.</p>

<p>My first design intention and brief included bringing an online catalogue for them to be able to add their products in the future, as well as somehow make the site resemble a book, a catalogue, or a brochure in some of the elements or interactions, with some slight small playful interactions that integrate conventional elements made out of paper.</p>

<!--This is a concept project I started in 2015 which I'll be getting into again in September, 2019. I will be creating a new more modern design following some of the UI I had already created and polishing the concept, as well as maintaining the classic brand look established since 1987 but making it shine in a modern website.-->
