	I studied marketing and advertising for 5 years of my life, which included hundreds of exercises on branding and campaigning, many public presentations, uncountable individual and group projects, analysing and learning about psychology, persuasion, ads, slogans and text analysis.
	<br /><br />I learned semiotics, linguistic, and how to comunicate and display to generate action and emotions; working with real brands, and reading a lot of texts, and books.
