A website project rounds up anywhere between USD $1,000 to $10,000. Estimates can vary widely depending on factors like timing, expectations, and each project's spectrum and resources involved; time required, the number of pages, the complexity of the development and/or the design phase, if a complete branding is in schedule or we are starting from an existing design or if there is already a full brand guideline, and the features needed for the website (plugins, videos, carrousels, popups, complex hover effects, scroll effects, animations, contact or signup forms, backend among any others).

<br><br>My prices are based on my 5 years experience working in an international digital agency and are competitive in the industry. As a reference please see <a class="text-rosybrown" href="https://designagency.io/" target="_blank">this tool</a>, which some agencies use, to compare the industry prices vs. working with me as a freelancer.

<ul class="text-left" style="font-size:14px;">
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>$1,000 - $2,000: <i class="font-ultra-light-italic"> This approximate budget will allow me to create a custom small site of a couple pages, a one pager site or a simple but awesome portfolio. We can also use a template based site, for example using a <a class="text-rosybrown" href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free" target="_blank">Jekyll Theme</a>, and accommodate your site and content to it, making some modifications to the theme to add a new section or a couple of new features, removing undesired items, changing colors to fit the brand, and more.</i></li>
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>$2,000 - $4,000: <i class="font-ultra-light-italic"> This will allow me to create a full custom website, with a hand-crafted design that is created to represent your brand and mirror your company's feel. It will have only what you need and will contain only what you want, with a design that you approve in the first or second week. It will have some effects and animations. If we use custom fonts or some plugin with a licence that you agree, approve, and want, like a fancy popup photo gallery, fancy video gallery or something similar, it will be at an extra cost; we can arrange a separate bill for a small cost (e.g Fancy Box Gallery costs around $25 USD). Some fonts (e.g Adobe fonts) or some special sites, come at a cost, varying from $30 USD to around $300 USD; we will only use any of these features or fonts if you approve as we find that it fits and gives the best image to the brand, or is required for some functionality.</i></li>
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>$4,000 - $7,000: <i class="font-ultra-light-italic"></i>This will give me the opportunity to create your full custom site, brand, logo, and all the visual identity, try to help and assist in anything else that you need to reach your goals. It will allow me to add plugins with licences without extra cost, use better stock galleries like 'shutterstock', if we are using one, and outsource the logo development, a video development, an illustration or some other work to a graphic designer, whilst retaining the lead on the concept and strategy, creating the best resources that fits your brand and site, and a site that fits your brand and taste.</li>
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>$7,000 - 10'000 or more: <i class="font-ultra-light-italic"> This budget will cover almost all the previous proposals/plans and will also allow me to hire a second graphic designer, a video editor, or a second professional to help in the development and design phase, to get much better results. It will specially give me more time, which will render in a much better and polished platform, with multiple engaging effects, page transitions, very customised animations, video production, if it is needed, or anything else needed to reach your goals and make you happy.</i></li>
</ul>
