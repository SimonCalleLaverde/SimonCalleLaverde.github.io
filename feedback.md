A website project rounds up anywhere between $1,000 to $10,000 USD, depending on each projects spectrum and the resources involved, the time required, the number of pages, the complexity of the design or development, and the features needed. My prices are based around my 5 years working in an agency although mine are a bit smaller, as I'm working independently and mostly by myself in a free-lancer work model. Also in reference to <a href="https://designagency.io/">this tool</a>, which some agencies will use, but again, prices there are anywhere from 2 to 10 times higher if you are working through an agency, than directly with a freelancer.

1. This will allow me to add plugins with licences without extra cost, use (better/more specialized) stock galleries like 'shutterstock', or even allow me to outsource work like logo development to a designer, still being me in charge of the strategy and identity concept, if we are doing a logo for your brand.
