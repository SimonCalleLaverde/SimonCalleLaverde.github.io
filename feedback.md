A website project rounds up anywhere between USD $1,000 to $10,000. Estimates can vary widely depending on factors like timing, expectations, and each project's spectrum and resources involved; time required, the number of pages, the complexity of the development and/or the design phase, if a complete branding is in schedule or we are starting from an existing design or there is already a full brand guideline, the features needed for the website (plugins, videos, carrousels, popups, complex hover effects, scroll effects, animations, contact or signup forms, backend among any others).

<br><br>My prices are based around my 5 years working in an international digital agency and the prices that similar agencies or freelancers take, although this are a bit smaller, as I'll be working independently and mostly by myself in a free-lance agreement and model of work. Also I like to reference to <a href="https://designagency.io/">this tool</a> which some agencies will use, to have a grasp on what a quality and full stack website can cost, but again, prices there are anywhere from 2 to 10 times higher if you are working through an agency, than directly with me or some other free-lancers.

<ul class="text-left" style="font-size:14px;">
	<br><br><li>$1,000 - $2,000: <i class="font-ultra-light-italic">This approximate budget will allow me to create a custom small site of a couple pages, a one pager site or something like a simple but awesome portfolio. We can also use some type of template based site, for example using a <a class="text-rosybrown" href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free" style="text-decoration:underline;">Jekyll Theme</a> and accomodating your site and content to it, making some numbered modifications to the theme to add a new section or a couple new features, removing anything that we won't use, changing colors to fit the brand, and more.</i></li>
	<br><br><li>$2,000 - $4,000: <i class="font-ultra-light-italic">This will allow me to create you a full custom website, with a hand-crafted design that is created to represent your brand and mirror your company's feel. It will have only what you need and will contain only what you want to say, with a design that you approve in the first or second week. It will have effects and animations, but not going too crazy. If we use custom fonts or some plugin with a licence that you agree, approve, and want, like a fancy popup photo gallery, fancy video gallery or something with an extra cost, we can arrange a separate bill with what might be a very small cost (i.e <i>Fancy Box Gallery</i> costs around $25 USD. Some fonts that have a cost like the Adobe fonts or some special sites, can vary from something like $30 USD to even $300 USD a special font family). We will only use any of this if we find any of those fits and gives the best image to the brand, or is required for some functionality.</i></li>
	<br><br><li>$4,000 - $7,000: <i class="font-ultra-light-italic">This will give me the oportunity to create your full custom site, brand, logo, and all the visual identity, try to help and assist in anything that you need to reach your goals. It will allow me to add plugins with licences without extra cost, use for example better stock galleries like 'shutterstock', if we are using one, or even allow me to outsource work like a logo development to a graphic designer, still being me the one in charge of the concept and strategy, creating a logo that fits your brand and site, and a site that fits your brand and taste.</i></li>
	<br><br><li>$7,000 - 10'000 or more: <i class="font-ultra-light-italic">This budget will cover almost all the previous proposals/plans and could also allow me to maybe hire a second graphic designer, a video editor, or a second proffesional to help in the development and design phase, to get much better results. It will specially give me more time, which will render in a much better and polished platform, with effects going crazy, page transitions, very customised animations, video production if it is needed, or almost whatever we need to reach your goals and make you happy.</i></li>
</ul>
