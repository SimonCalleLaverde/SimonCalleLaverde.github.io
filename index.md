I'm Simón Calle Laverde, I studied marketing and advertisement for 5 years in the <a href="">Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano</a> of Bogotá D.C, Colombia, and I have a passion for branding, design, and coding awesome <em>hand-crafted</em> unique business websites.


I worked internationally for the past 4 years and a half together with the team of Code Nation creating robust and powerful campaigns for different small and big organizations, but all with big goals and ideas.
