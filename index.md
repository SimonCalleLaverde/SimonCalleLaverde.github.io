  headline: Some sites I have <a class="headline text-uppercase smoothScroll" href="#content_development"><span>developed</span></a> through the past five years
  content: |
    <p>This websites were in their mayority designed by Code Nation's designers for client's approval and to be able to then continue to development phase with a full concept, an approved full design with all the required and asked features visible as wireframes created mostly in <i>Photoshop</i>, <i>Illustrator</i> or <i>Adobe XD</i>, very close to the final product as a visual PDF (but this designs aren't a website, just yet...), and so nothing slips through the cracks later. Also avoiding unexpected results at the end in terms of design or the UX concept, so everything is clear from start before beginning the actual website development. Final images and content is normally added by the clients.</p>
    <p>Then I developed and re-created those visual designs in code <i>(using: HTML</i>, <i>SCSS</i>, <i>Liquid</i> and <i>Javascript)</i> as a full dynamic website template following those designs as a guide. Starting sometimes with Bootstrap, sometimes with Slides or some with NationBuilder templates, our mayor skill was to completelly transform and customize those templates which at the end won't resemble the original, but more the new designs. I re-designed the whole website in code including every colour, corner, section and every single page making them also dynamic with Nation Builder's backend in some cases, in some others using Forestry.io, adding then finally sometimes the real content and others placeholder content and images as the client will be able and documented on how to upload everything and manage its site.</p>
    <p>Then we could also eventually add other functionalities, new pages, some in-development design changes or tweaks to the theme, creating new sections or anything coming from our client's feedback during the years and this could have been done by any one in the team.</p>
