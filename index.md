    <h6 class="text-grey-light">Below are some of the websites I have worked on.</h6>
    <h6 class="text-grey-light">I worked at <a class="link text-codenation" href="https://www.codenation.com/" target="_blank" title="Check out their amazing work or contact them for any cool campaigning related project">Code Nation</a> for the past four years, an Australian 5 star rated digital agency specialized in creating robust and awesome campaigning platforms that allow managing big communities and help them engage in big actions.</h6>

    <p class="text-white mt-1">I'll be starting to work on some freelance projects through this very website and portfolio, as well as hoping to transitions little by little to attach some more of my new independent work and new business and branding related projects. Also I'll be improving on this site and expanding on the design for the display of projects in their own internal pages plus adding some other features in the future.</p>
    <p class="text-white mt-1">For now, the collection of projects include my work at Code Nation, as well as a concept small site I created in 2015 and another business website I started in 2015 and I'll be retaking in 2019, with a newest and more modern design.</p>

I'm Sim√≥n Calle Laverde. I worked at <a class="text-codenation" href="www.codenation.com"><u>Code Nation</u></a> for over 4 years, an international 5 star rated creative agency developing awesome platforms for progressive campaigners. Our platforms helped our clients reach more people and allow them to engage with the cause, as well as letting them manage and organize huge bases of data and help those people to take action. Our clients were mostly based in Australia, some in Colombia and some in the United States.
