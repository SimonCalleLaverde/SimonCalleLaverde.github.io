I'm Simón Calle Laverde, I studied marketing and advertisement for 5 years in the <a href="">Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano</a> in Bogotá, Colombia, and I have a passion for branding, design, and coding awesome <em>hand-crafted</em> websites for businesses and organizations.

I worked with the team of <a href="www.codenation.com">Code Nation</a>, a 5 star rated international company for the past 4 years and a half. There we created dozens of robust and powerful campaign platforms for both growing small and big organizations, all with very big goals and ideas.
