            Hello! Here I'm displaying some case studies I'm actively working on.
          </p>

          <p>
            I worked with the great team of <a class="text-rosybrown" href="https://www.codenation.com/" target="_blank">Code Nation</a>, a five star rated digital and creative agency headquartered in Australia for over 4 years; we developed dozens of awesome websites and campaign platforms for awesome clients around the world both onsite and remotely, to help this planet a bit. Most of the projects displayed here are those which I worked in the development phase starting from a base design and a base template we iterated on, and worked on most of the development phase at the time. Some may have new changes throught the years.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm currently occasionally taking on freelance projects! Although this year was a roller coaster. I have been also improving on my skills: I've been learning much more about <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">UX research</em>, <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">UI design</em>, <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">web best practices</em>, as well as improving my coding skills with <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">JavaScript</em> and <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">React.js</em>. The first projects are a few I had the opportunity to recently design & develop completelly.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm also working on some desings-only to display and better show my UI design skills which really started more than 6 years ago with a University course in <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">Web Design and Design for Mobile Devices</em> after a 5 year creative and design focused career where I also had to create complete digital marketing campaigns including wireframing, prototyping, and creating mockups (at that time with Adobe Fireworks and Adobe Dreamweaver,<!--<img src="/uploads/smile-face.png" style="height:15px">--> although today I use mostly Adobe XD and I have knowledge on Figma).<!--and Sketch--><!--<img src="/uploads/heart.webp" style="height:15px">-->
