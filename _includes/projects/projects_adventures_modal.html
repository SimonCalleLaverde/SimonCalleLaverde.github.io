              At the beginning of 2021 I went a bit "hippie" and went almost leaving to my farm for some months, were I also started improving my JavaScript and learning React.

              In the second half I bought a car, fixed problems in my live, and started learning Next.js. I also worked for someone in the USA (<a class="text-grey-dark" href="https://institutodenegocios.com/" target="_blank">Instituto De Negocios</a>) who spent on me to learn a lot of LinkedIn Ads and some social media digital marketing and campaigning, taking some courses first and reading lots of documentation, atteding webinars, and more to then pop some campaigns in November and December.

              I taught them all what I learned, tips and tricks I was suggested, and we finally reached the point to gain about 500+ followers more and enable "Live Videos" which they wanted to be able to stream from now on.
