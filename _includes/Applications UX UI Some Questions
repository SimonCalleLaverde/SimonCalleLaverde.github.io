-- Why are you applying for this role? What makes you excited about Grafana Labs?

Hello Grafana Labs,

I'll like to enroll in a UX research and UI designer job with a tech company like yours, to help elevate your brand and design feel for the experience of your users.



-- How do you keep focused in a remote setting?

I worked remotely for more than 4 years for an international Australian company: Code Nation Australia from the commodity of my country. We had just a few meet ups in Australia and Colombia.

We had a great team workflow, with once or twice weekly updates and feedback, daily work tracking at the end of each day, and daily tasks. I had no problem on spending 8 hours a day very focused on any given work. Work required to be done because something new will come the next day.

Also, remote work always requires people that are "self-responsible" for their own company and job. Work never stops and never stopped for me in 4 years working remotely.



-- How has your understanding of the designer's role evolved over the years?

I had a very close engagement with Graphic Design and Graphic Designers in both my career, and my 6 years in the web development industry. I spend a great part of the last year learning much more about web design, taking courses, creating projects, and inspiring myself from the best and award winning websites and platforms.

I know how design can impact in the emotions of a client, how design can persuade to take a certain action, and how a concise visual identity based in good design and easy to consume content, is crucial.



-- How has your process changed over the years?

Basically I started with a background in designing and conceptualizing always focused on creating action and sales, which is marketing and advertisement. I gained knowledge around psychology, visual semiotics, good linguistics, copywriting and more.

I took courses on web as I wanted to apply all my knowledge in digital platforms. Have now a great experience in development, but I want to expand and focus more in my design and user experience skills, applied in user interface designs.



-- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

I'm a passionate web developer and designer with a background in marketing and advertisement.

-- What do you think makes a great user experience?

A great user experience can be provided in digital platforms with a user interface that is simple, easy to consume, and is intuitive in nature, sometimes following best practice guidelines, and assuming that the user can be critical and creative too.......
