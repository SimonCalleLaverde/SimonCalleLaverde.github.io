<p>Something to mention here is this website was developed during a recent team-catchup we all in the team of Code Nation took in Australia around March of 2019, so work was a bit different than usual and was very nice being able to colaborate directly with the designers and rest of the team every day working on this project, different as we accustomed lately as for the two latest years we worked remotedly resembling a 3.0 model of work.</p>
