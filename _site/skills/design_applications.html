<p><span class="font-light">Adobe XD &amp; Figma</span><br />Adobe XD is the primary tool that I use for creating wireframes, mockups, and prototypes. Although I've been learning some Figma too as it is widely used for collaboration scenarios<!--sceneries--><!--purposes--><!--, for presenting a project, and for getting feedback-->.</p>

<p><span class="font-light">Adobe Illustrator</span><br />Is a tool I have used extensively from the beginning of my career for vector based graphics like ad designs, flyers, business cards, posters, and creating or re-creating logos during my career<!--university studies-->.</p>

<p><span class="font-light">Adobe Photoshop</span><br />Is a complimentary tool for photo edition to be used in conjunction with Adobe Illustrator and other apps. Adobe Illustrator is 'object' based while Adobe Photoshop is 'image' based. I used it extensively especially at <a class="text-rosybrown" href="https://www.utadeo.edu.co/es" target="blank">university</a><!-- and even school--><!--, but also working and learning in a photography studio-->. I also took a course in photography for over 5 years since <a class="text-rosybrown" href="http://campoalegre.edu.co/" target="blank">school</a> and worked in a photography studio where I also learned and used Adobe Photoshop. I created a monograph project for school graduation about <!--advertising photography --><em>Photography for Advertising</em>, so I learned a lot of photo edition since. This work also took me to choose my university career.
