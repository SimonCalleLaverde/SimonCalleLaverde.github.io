<p><span class="font-light"><!--Marketing & -->Advertising</span><br />I have a bachelor's degree and title as a <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">Publicist</em> having undertaken a 5 year career focused in advertising, a branch of marketing which is mainly about persuasion. I studied design, history of design, visual semiotics, linguistics, psychology, sociology, created all types of ads, full campaigns, copy, slogans, created branding, analized all types of brands and campaigns worldwide, created ATL &amp; BTL campaigns, created story boards, filmed and edited commercials, created radio spots, implemented messages in all type of communication channels, set digital marketing campaigns, and even learned some web design which took me to continue that digital path, taking a course after graduating.</p>

<!--advertising design, campaigning, and marketing; including numerous exercises and projects on branding, public presentations and hundreds of individual and group projects creating ATL & BTL advertising, commercials, social media marketing campaigns, and even learning some digital marketing and some web design. I put an important focus on the psychology of persuasion underpinning communication, ads, copy, slogans, and promotional text. My background involves a deep understanding of the importance of visual semiotics and linguistics, creating messages and visual designs that touch on human emotions and ultimately generate action.-->

<p><span class="font-light">Digital Marketing</span><br />I had the oportunity at the end of 2021 to work about 2 months for <a class="text-rosybrown" href="https://institutodenegocios.com/" target="blank">Instituto De Negocios</a> located in USA in a spanish speaking area<!--place-->, to impulse their social media marketing and digital marketing strategy especially <!--using-->introducing LinkedIn Ads and LinkedIn's organic content. In a few days we went from around 120 followers to more than 600. I took around 3 courses from LinkedIn Training, Udemy, and other sources we found. I taught them all what I learned, we created organic content, small test campaigns, managed bids, budgets and timelines<!--ad programming-->, different ad formats<!--, and more-->. We also got the approval to create LinkedIn Live Streams and Videos which<!-- they needed and--> required a few steps to <!--request-->apply for.</p>

<p><span class="font-light">Branding<!-- & Identity--></span><br /><!--Branding was a big focus in my career, we analyzed everything about brands and the phychology around all their marketing, each advertizing piece and the why of everything, from a logo to a full advertising campaign.--><!-- <small class="font-ultra-light">- Even the colors i.e. in Mc Donals were decided by phychologists and publicists, and they have a why, they let you a sense of eagerness so you eat and go, you don't stay too much there; just one of thousands of examples. -</small>--><!-- We analyzed and created concept logos from scratch, color schemes, and brands, studying color theory and experimenting with color psychology, as well as understanding the elements that compose a logo which is in simple words: Reducing a brand to its minimal visual components.-->I can help <!--you-->businesses build a strong brand conceptual and visual identity that reflects <!--your-->their company's culture and feel. Branding encompasses much more than just a logo or graphic design, it goes into the whole experience and the brand's recognition and positioning in people's minds, looking to accomplish top-of-mind awareness.</p>

<p><span class="font-light">Copywriting</span><br />I believe language is essential; one word can change everything.<!-- One word can change the whole meaning of a message and create another complete different result. For this reason, my studies covered some semesters of linguistics and I put a lot of emphasis on good grammar. <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">Copy</em> and <em class="font-ultra-light text-italic">copywriting</em> are essencial for marketing and advertising, and Copy (or Copywriter) is even one of the advertising agencies' main roles.--> I studied a few semesters of linguistics at <a class="text-rosybrown" href="https://www.utadeo.edu.co/es" target="blank">university</a>. My native language is Spanish though I am also able to produce native-level English for projects for you.</p>
