<p><span class="font-light">Adobe Premiere</span><br />I have an introductory knowledge of Adobe Premiere, having utilised it in commercials that I have edited, concept videos, and short films that I created at <a class="text-rosybrown" href="https://www.utadeo.edu.co/es" target="blank">university</a>; I had a film class where I learned all about cinematic shots, edition, and more, and another where I also created story-boards and short films which we also edited using Adobe Premiere<!-- and learned other more proffesional tools too-->. Among many other small projects.</p>

<p><span class="font-light">Adobe After Effects</span><br />Similar to Adobe Premiere, I have a base knowledge and experience, having used it in experimental projects that required 3D effects or the Adobe After Effects 3D camera, I experimented with moving image-tracking to locate elements that followed a person, logo animation, video intro animations, and other animations and effects.</p>
