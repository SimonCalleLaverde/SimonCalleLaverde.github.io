The development phase could be done directly without a design, but it is always better to have a visual and approved concept to follow and re-create exactly in a web format and a visual language that the browsers understands and can display, and to also make sure that nothing slips through the cracks and there is non unexpected elements missing later.

This is normally the longest part of the project and can take anywhere from 2 weeks to even a month or 2, depending on the size and complexity of each project and the resources used or created.

A backend and customizing it and configuring can also be an option for development phase, so the site becomes completelly dynamic and all texts and images editable, or the possibility to add and publish for example news, events or videos very easily.
