The development phase could be done without a design, but it is always better to have a visual and approved concept to follow and re-create in a web format and a visual language that the browsers understands and can display. Having a design will also help ensure that nothing slips through the cracks when building the actual website in HTML and CSS.

This is normally the longest part of the project and can take anywhere from 2 weeks to even a month or 2, depending on the size and complexity of each project. A backend, customizing and configuring it, can also be an option in the development phase. With this, the site becomes completely dynamic and all texts and images editable. It also gives the possibility to add and publish news, events or videos very easily.
