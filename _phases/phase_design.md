The design is the second stage of a website project, a design is a visual concept of the site, most of the times showing how it will visually look, sometimes using placeholder images and texts. Altho, the best is to start organizing some headlines, texts, and quotes from start or at least a first approach to them, a sitemap, and the general website's concept so that at the end the site <!--ends-->results as a platform and template that you can easily edit, fill with images or change any information in the future, and that suits your exact needs, brand feel, and exactly what it was intended to say and contain.

This websites are completelly customized and designed from a blank canvas, following any type of design trend. I will start by showing you some similar sites, concepts, and design visuals to see what is a better fit for your business. A first version design will take around a week, altho if we are doing a whole branding it should take a bit more.
