The design is the second stage of a website project. A design is a visual concept of the site, showing how it will look, sometimes using placeholder images and texts. Although, it is better to use real headlines and prepare some texts and quotes from the start - or at least a first approach to them - a sitemap, and the general website’s concept in order for the site to become a platform and template that you can easily edit in the future and suits your exact needs, brand feel, and ever changing content. For example replacing an image or any other information as your needs evolve.

These websites are fully customized and designed from a blank canvas, following any type of design trend. I will start by showing you similar sites, concepts, and design visuals to see what would be a good fit for your business. A first version design will take around a week. Whole branding concepts can take a little longer.
