The <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">UI Design</em> is the second stage of a website project.

This phase of the project consist of creating <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">mockups</em> and the <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">visual concept</em> of the site, showing how it will look, using mostly placeholder images and texts with some real content. Although, it is better to use real headlines and prepare some texts and quotes from the beginning, or at least a first approach to them, a sitemap, and the general website’s concept in order for the site to become a platform that you can easily edit in the future and suits your exact needs, brand feel, and ever changing content. For example replacing an image or any other information as your needs evolve.

The design should make users find the product or service easy to use, <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">intuitive</em>, and <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">seamless</em>. It should use <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">hierarchy</em>, good <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">typography</em>, <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">readability</em>, <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">spacing</em> to let the user breathe and better consume the content, and maintain <em class="text-ultra-light text-italic text-aqua">brand consistency</em>. They will associate a good experience with the brand as a whole.

My project websites are 100% custom, following any type of design trend we perceive better for the type of project. I will start by showing you similar sites, concepts, and design visuals to see what would be a good fit for your business. A first version design will take around a week after the first strategy stage and communication. With a whole branding concept it can take until two weeks or even a little longer.

<!--.................................

The design is the second stage of a website project, a design is a visual concept of the site, most of the times showing how it will visually look, sometimes using placeholder images and texts. Altho, the best is to start organizing some headlines, texts, and quotes from start or at least a first approach to them, a sitemap, and the general website's concept so that at the end the site results as a platform and template that you can easily edit, fill with images or change any information in the future, and that suits your exact needs, brand feel, and exactly what it was intended to say and contain.

This websites are completelly customized and designed from a blank canvas, following any type of design trend. I will start by showing you some similar sites, concepts, and design visuals to see what is a better fit for your business. A first version design will take around a week, altho if we are doing a whole branding it should take a bit more.-->
