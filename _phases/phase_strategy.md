Every great project starts with the strategy, after composing a first brief with the purpose and vision of it; this is the base and main pillar of a website or branding project. This step will consist of taking me through your business, your vision and your expected results, in a series of meetings at the beginning of the journey. This allows me to get insights into what you desire and align expectations from the start of the design process.

If you don’t have branding, we can create your visual identity based on many things. For example, references of what you have seen or liked, your competitors' brand, your name, the culture or feel of your company, amongst others. In this first phase, you will get to understand our use of a visual concept or even a certain color, and will be able to give feedback on the direction we are taking. Branding is an important step, so that we can get to a successful result.

If you don't have a branding we can create your visual identity based on many things: For example references of what you have seen or liked, your competition's brands, your name, the culture of your company or the feel. You will understand why we'll use a certain visual concept or even a certain color, and will be able to give me any feedback on anything. Branding can make the design phase take longer, so that we can get to a succesful result.--> <!--It can also imply contracting a second designer depending on your choise.-->
