Everything starts with the strategy, this is the base and main part of a website project or a branding project. This will consist in talking about it and knowing more about your business and your expected results. This will be set up as one or a series of reunions or chats at the beginning of the work, to align expectations and be sure to get enough insight so that everything is clear to start with a design.

If you don't have a branding we can create your visual identity based on many things: For example references of what you have seen or liked, your competition's brands, your name, the culture of your company or the feel. You will understand why we'll use a certain visual concept or even a certain color, and will be able to give me any feedback on anything. Branding can make the design phase take longer, so that we can get to a succesful result. <!--It can also imply contracting a second designer depending on your choise.-->
