<p>- <span class="font-light">Adobe XD:</span>From the Adobe family, it is the tool I use for designing Websites.</p>

<p>- <span class="font-light">Illustrator:</span> A tool I have used extensively from the beginning of my education and career, though less in the recent past.</p>

<p>- <span class="font-light">Photoshop:</span> This tool should always be used as a complementary to Illustrator, for any images. I used it extensively specially at university.

<p>- <span class="font-light">Corel Draw:</span> Coming from a family that works in the design and print industry (graphic arts) I learnt and used Corel Draw since I was a child. I have done some posters using this tool in past years.</p>
