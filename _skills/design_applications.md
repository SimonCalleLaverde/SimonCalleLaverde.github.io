<p><span class="font-light">Adobe XD & Figma</span><br>Adobe XD is the primary tool I use for designing websites, although I've been learning some around Figma too as it is more useful for collaboration sceneries, for presenting a project, and for getting feedback.</p>

<p><span class="font-light">Adobe Illustrator</span><br>Is a tool I have used extensively from the beginning of my career for vector based elements; I have used it for advertising designs and creating or re-creating some logos during my university studies.</p>

<p><span class="font-light">Adobe Photoshop</span><br>Is a complimentary tool for photo edition to be used in conjunction with Illustrator, one is 'object' based and the other 'image' based. I used it extensively specially at university. I also took a course in photography for 5 years since school and worked in a photography studio, I created a monograph project around advertising photography, so I had to learn a lot of photo edition.

<p><span class="font-light">CorelDRAW</span><br>Coming from a family that works in the graphic arts, design, and print industry, I have used this editor since I was a child, which also mixes some of Illustrator's and Photoshop's capabilities but much less widely used. Instead of watching too much cartoons, I was doing stuff in CorelDRAW.<!-- While my friends watched cartoons, I was doing stuff in CorelDRAW :)--></p>
