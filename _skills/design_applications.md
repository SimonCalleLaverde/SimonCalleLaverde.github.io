<p>- <span class="font-light">Adobe XD:</span> From the Adobe family, it is the tool I use for designing Websites. I'm very good but also learning every day more.</p>

<p>- <span class="font-light">Illustrator:</span> I had used Illustrator forever but didn't used it for the past 5 years. I'm average but I can do almost anything I need with vectors.</p>

<p>- <span class="font-light">Photoshop:</span> I'm good at it, this tool should always be used as a complementary to Illustrator, the first for vector based elements or called <i class="font-light-italic">objects</i> within the app, and Photoshop for any <i class="font-light-italic">images</i>. I experienced all college with this two.</p>

<p>- <span class="font-light">Corel Draw:</span> I was born using this one. From a family that works in the design and print industry (graphic arts) I experienced with Corel Draw all my life since childhood. I have done some posters with it, but no recent works in the past years.</p>
