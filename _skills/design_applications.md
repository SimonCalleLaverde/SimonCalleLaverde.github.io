<p><span class="font-light">Adobe XD & Figma</span><br>Adobe XD is the primary tool that I use for creating wireframes, mockups, and prototypes. Although I've been learning some Figma too as it is widely used for collaboration <!--sceneries-->purposes<!--, for presenting a project, and for getting feedback-->.</p>

<p><span class="font-light">Adobe Illustrator</span><br>Is a tool I have used extensively from the beginning of my career for vector based graphics like ad designs, flyers, business cards, posters, and creating or re-creating logos during my career<!--university studies-->.</p>

<p><span class="font-light">Adobe Photoshop</span><br>Is a complimentary tool for photo edition to be used in conjunction with Adobe Illustrator and other apps. Adobe Illustrator is 'object' based while Adobe Photoshop is 'image' based. I used it extensively especially at <a class="text-rosybrown" href="https://www.utadeo.edu.co/es" target="blank">university</a><!-- and even school--><!--, but also working and learning in a photography studio-->. I also took a course in photography for over 5 years since <a class="text-rosybrown" href="http://campoalegre.edu.co/" target="blank">school</a> and worked in a photography studio where I also learned and used Adobe Photoshop. I created a monograph project for school graduation about <!--advertising photography --><em>Photography for Advertisement</em>, so I learned a lot of photo edition since and that took me to my university career too.

<p><span class="font-light">CorelDRAW</span><br>Coming from a family that works in the graphic arts, design, and print industry, I have used this editor since I was a child<!--, which also-->. It mixes some of Illustrator's and Photoshop's <!--capabilities-->functionalities but is much less widely used.<!-- Instead of watching too many cartoons, I was doing stuff in CorelDRAW.--><!-- While my friends watched cartoons, I was doing stuff in CorelDRAW :)--></p>
