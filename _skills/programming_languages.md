title: Markup & Programming Languages
order: 1

<p>- <span class="font-light">HTML.5:</span> I have around 7 years of evolving and working around with this markup language, and more than 40 sites I have worked on. Some not displayed in this folio.</p>
<p>- <span class="font-light">CSS.3 & SASS:</span> This is the language I have more experience on and which I like the most. Recently even used in spaceship interfaces, CSS known well can have superpowers.</p>
<p>- <span class="font-light">Liquid Code:</span> Used in Shopify e-commerce websites, NationBuilder campaigning websites and some static site generators, I'm relatively good at it, being able to create and accomplish more than the regular. I have 5 years of experience with this language building dozens of dynamic sites.</p>
<p>- <span class="font-light">Javascript:</span> One of the if not the most important programing language, I'm still getting better, having done casual work but currently expanding my knowledge to be able to master it.</p>
<p>- <span class="font-light">React Js:</span> I have small knowledge, but it is a tool in my schedule to expand my learning and probably transfer my newest sites to this language using Next.js in the future.</p>
<p>- <span class="font-light">Greenstock Animation Platform:</span> Currently I have used it in some projects, but I'm still learning to give even more life to my future sites.</p>
