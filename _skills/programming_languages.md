<p><span class="font-light">HTML5</span><br>I have over 7 years of experience and working with this markup language and I have worked on more than 40 web projects, with a selection displayed in this portfolio. I love using good HTML semantics, coherent, organized, and hierarchical markup, and I'm always trying to think in accessibility when writing the HTML.</p>

<p><span class="font-light">CSS3 & SASS</span><br>CSS is a styling language I have 7 years of experience with. Easy to learn, but hard to master. I have experience working with pure CSS and especially with CSS preprocessor languages like SASS<!-- or Less-->. CSS, when used to its full extent can be very powerful. Modern web responsive design is all in the CSS, it was stablished to be no longer in the HTML and styles should be independent from the content. You may want to re-size your screen and check out this portfolio in responsive, that will show some CSS skills. I love CSS.</p><!--Knowing and using CSS well can be very, very powerful.-->

<p><span class="font-light">Liquid Code</span><br>This is a language used to create dynamic websites. It is used in Shopify e-commerce websites, NationBuilder campaigning platforms and some static site generators. I have 5 years of experience with this language building dozens of dynamic sites easy to edit for the clients.</p><!--My experience using this language has meant I am able to accomplish more than the regular.-->

<p><span class="font-light">Javascript & React</span><br>I retain a working knowledge of the language which I continue to expand on an ongoing basis. My short term goal now is to become proficient at JavaScript and React.js, I'm currently taking some courses improving my JS skills and learning React.</p><!--I'm currently expanding my knowledge and focusing on learning it better to be able to master it.-->

<!--<p><span class="font-light">React Js</span><br>I retain a working knowledge of the language, and is my main focus to expand my current skillset. I intend on transferring some of my newest sites to this language using Next.js in the future.</p>--><!--I have small knowledge-->

<!--<p><span class="font-light">Green Sock Animation Platform</span><br>It is currently powering some of the animations in this portfolio and a couple of my recent projects. I continue to expand my capabilities to give even more life to future sites and create more interesting interactive designs.</p>-->
