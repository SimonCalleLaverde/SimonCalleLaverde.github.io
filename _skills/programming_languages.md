<p><span class="font-light">HTML5</span><br>I have over 7 years of experience working with this markup language and I have worked and collaborated on at least 40 web projects using HTML5. I love using good HTML semantics, coherent, organized, and hierarchical markup code. Also always trying to think in accessibility.</p>

<p><span class="font-light">CSS3 (SCSS & SASS)</span><br>CSS is an <em>easy to learn, but hard to master</em> styling language that I have 7 years of experience with. I have experience working with pure CSS and especially with CSS preprocessor languages like SCSS<!--SASS--><!-- or Less-->. <!--CSS, -->When used to its full extent, CSS can be very powerful.<!-- Modern web responsive design is all in the CSS, it was stablished to be no longer in the HTML and styles should be independent from structure.--><!-- You may want to re-size your screen and check out this portfolio in responsive, that will show some CSS skills.--> I love CSS.</p><!--Knowing and using CSS well can be very, very powerful.-->

<p><span class="font-light">JavaScript</span><br><!--Although most of the sites I have worked on have at least some JavaScript for simple interactions, plus I also implemented more complex JS and many playful elements through all this portfolio website and my two latest sites, following some documentation and making hundreds of modifications to adapt everything with purpose into my unique designs and websites, like this one on every page. -->I <!--took a basic JS course in the past and -->have implemented some JavaScript for simple interactions in most of the sites I have worked on. I can also implement more complex JS interactions like the ones in this portfolio and my other recent projects. I can follow documentation, modify <!--experimental -->JS examples and create almost anything. But now in 2021 & 2022 I have focused around 3 months on improving and cementing my vanilla JavaScript to have a stronger base and then having a smoother transition to ReactJS.</p>

<p><span class="font-light">ReactJS</span><br>My short term goal now is to become proficient at ReactJS and its stack<!-- (and vanilla JS as well),-->. Using NextJS<!-- (JAMstack)-->, GatsbyJS, and React Native is my main goal<!--, and more-->. <!--I'm currently -->In 2021 I was taking some courses and learning React<!-- which I'm loving-->. <!--I'll re-do my portfolio for a version 3 using it soon. --><!--I'm working-->I was and currently are working on some <!--experimental small Apps-->small experiments, projects, and Apps<!-- now too--> using ReactJS and NextJS,<!-- and--> some APIs<!-- (like edamam's: <em>https://www.edamam.com/</em>)-->, and more<!--; I'll want to display them later when I have a MVP to show-->. Everything is currently in my GitHub.</p>

<p><span class="font-light">NextJS</span><br>I'm currently learning NextJS (a ReactJS <!--meta -->framework) as<!-- part of the ReactJS stack--> it is <!--awesome and it is -->becoming very popular, to be able to take advantage of its <em>Server-side Rendering</em>, <em>Static site generation</em>, <em>Incremental Static Regeneration</em>, and more capabilities using ReactJS, in addition to the default ReactJS's <em>Client-side rendering</em> for single-page Apps. I'm currently building my new website in NextJS.</p>

<!--Now even Shopify has its own new JavaScript Framework: Hydrogen-->

<p><span class="font-light">Liquid Code</span><br>Liquid is a templating language used to create dynamic websites and pull dynamic content. It is used in Shopify's e-commerce websites, NationBuilder's campaigning platforms and some static site generators (or JAMstack sites: The new standard architecture for the web) like Jekyll. I have 5 years of experience using this language building dozens of dynamic sites easy to edit for the clients, using a similar structure to "components" or partial/snippet code in its own files, pulling and looping through dynamic content and rendering HTML, similar to the concept of React "props" printing and looping through dynamic content to render <!--JSX (or extended HTML code)-->HTML.</p><!--My experience using this language has meant I am able to accomplish more than the regular.-->

<p><span class="font-light">Liquid Code</span><br>I worked for at least 5 years using Liquid Code, the templating language created by Shopify and used to create dynamic and easy to edit websites, pulling dynamic content from data-bases or content management systems, looping through data, using conditionals and logic, and rendering static HTML from <!--dynamic-->ever changing sources.</p>

<!--<p><span class="font-light">Javascript & React</span><br>I retain a working knowledge of the language which I continue to expand on an ongoing basis. My short term goal now is to become proficient at JavaScript and React.js, I'm currently taking some courses improving my JS skills and learning React.</p>--><!--I'm currently expanding my knowledge and focusing on learning it better to be able to master it.-->

<!--<p><span class="font-light">React Js</span><br>I retain a working knowledge of the language, and is my main focus to expand my current skillset. I intend on transferring some of my newest sites to this language using Next.js in the future.</p>--><!--I have small knowledge-->

<!--<p><span class="font-light">Green Sock Animation Platform</span><br>It is currently powering some of the animations in this portfolio and a couple of my recent projects. I continue to expand my capabilities to give even more life to future sites and create more interesting interactive designs.</p>-->
