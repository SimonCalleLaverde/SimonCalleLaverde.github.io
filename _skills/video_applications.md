<p>- <span class="font-light">Adobe Premiere:</span> I have some knowledge and experience with this tool, I made some works with it, I have edited some videos and small commercials, but I have not much contact with the program any more. I'm less than intermediate in this one, but will like to learn much more in the future.</p>

<p>- <span class="font-light">Adobe After Effects:</span> Similar to Adobe Premiere, I have some knowledge and experience. I had created some projects and exercises with 3D effects, elements following a person, logos and some more. But nothing fancy. I'm less than intermediate, but I still consider this as one tool I know and could better my knowledge if given the projects or opportunity.</p>
