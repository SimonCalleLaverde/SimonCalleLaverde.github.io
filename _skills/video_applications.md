<p><span class="font-light">Adobe Premiere</span><br>I have an introductory knowledge of Adobe Premiere, having utilised it in commercials that I have edited, concept videos, and short films that I created at University; I had a film class where I learned all about cinematic shots, edition, and more, and another where I also created short films and story-boards, editing using Adobe Premiere.</p>

<p><span class="font-light">Adobe After Effects</span><br>Similar to Adobe Premiere, I have a base knowledge and experience, having used it in experimental projects that required 3D effects or the Adobe After Effects 3D camera, I experimented with moving-image tracking to put effects that followed a person moving, logo animation, and more.</p>
