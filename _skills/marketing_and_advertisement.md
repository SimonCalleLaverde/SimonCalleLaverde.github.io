<p><span class="font-light">Marketing & Advertisement</span><br>I have a 5 year career in marketing and advertisement, which included hundreds of exercises on branding and campaigning, many public presentations and numerous individual and group projects. I put an important focus on the psychology of persuasion underpinning advertisements, slogans, and promotional text. My work involves a deep understanding of the importance of semiotics and linguistics, and how that allows you to communicate in a way that generates action and emotions which translate in to sales.</p>

<p><span class="font-light">Branding</span><br>My university education focussed on branding, identity design, and advertisement. From initial brand concepts, right through to full advertising campaigns, I can help you build a strong brand conceptual and visual identity. I am able to assist whether on a full suite of strategies across the ATL / BTL marketing spectrum, including social media campaigns designed to create action.</p><!--Branding is a branch of marketing, as well as advertisement is.-->

<p><span class="font-light">Copywriting</span><br>I believe language is essential; one word can change everything. For this reason, my studies covered some semesters of linguistics and I put a lot of emphasis on good grammar. My native language is Spanish though I am also able to produce native-level English for projects for you, should it be required.</p>
