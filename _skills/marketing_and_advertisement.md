<p><span class="font-light">Marketing & Advertising</span><br>I have a 5 year career in Marketing and Advertising, which included hundreds of exercises on branding and campaigning, many public presentations and numerous individual and group projects. I put an important focus on the psychology of persuasion underpinning ads, slogans, and promotional text. My work involves a deep understanding of the importance of visual semiotics and linguistics, and creating messages and visual designs that interact with human emotions and ultimately generate action.</p>

<p><span class="font-light">Branding</span><br>Branding and identity was a big focus in my career, analyzing everything about brands and logos, creating logos from scratch, color schemes, studying color theory and experimenting with color psychology, as well as understanding the elements that compose a logo which is in simple words: Reducing a brand to its minimal visual components. I can help you build a strong brand conceptual and visual identity as per your company's culture and feel.</p>

<p><span class="font-light">Copywriting</span><br>I believe language is essential; one word can change everything, one word can change the whole meaning of a message and create another complete different reaction. For this reason, my studies covered some semesters of linguistics and I put a lot of emphasis on good grammar. Copy and copywriting are essencial for advertising, and it's even one of the advertising agencies main roles. My native language is Spanish though I am also able to produce native-level English for projects for you.</p>
